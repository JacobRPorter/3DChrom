Jmol building notes

Building Jmol properly requires three projects:

Jmol
JSmol
JSpecView

- JSpecView: Jmol needs JSpecView's jar file, so if there are changes, to JSpecView, start there.
  The build.xml in JSpecView will copy files to Jmol (to appletfiles/ and jars/).

- Jmol: update org.jmol.viewer.Jmol.properties and check it in so that it gets a new time stamp.
        Jmol.properties is also used by JSmol (along with all the Jmol java files).

- JSmol: run:

			 build_01_fromjmol.xml
			 build_02_fromjspecview.xml
			 build_03_tojs_stable.xml
			 
    		 This produces the minified files. Test files are in site/jsmol.
    
	     
- JSmol: Update and check in jsmol files

buildzip.xml can also be used to just create the ZIP file.
