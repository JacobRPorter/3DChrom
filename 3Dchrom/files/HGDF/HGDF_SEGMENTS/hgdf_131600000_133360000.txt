They usually occur linked to a protein to form proteoglycans. Two subgroups exist, one in which the sulfate is on the 4-position (chondroitin sulfate A) and the second in which it is in the 6-position (chondroitin sulfate C). They often are polydisperse and often differ in the degree of sulfation from tissue to tissue. The chains of repeating disaccharide are covalently linked to the side chains of serine residues in the polypeptide backbone of a protein by a glycosidic attachment through the trisaccharide unit galactosyl-galactosyl-xylosyl. Chondroitin sulfate B is more usually known as dermatan sulfate.

In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions.
