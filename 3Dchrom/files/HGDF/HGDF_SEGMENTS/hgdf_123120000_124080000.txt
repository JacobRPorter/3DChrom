[GOC:ceb, GOC:mah, ISBN:0198506732]"*A cell cycle process comprising the steps by which the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell divides; the process involves condensation of chromosomal DNA into a highly compacted form. Canonically, mitosis produces two daughter nuclei whose chromosome complement is identical to that of the mother cell. [GOC:dph, GOC:ma, GOC:mah, ISBN:0198547684]"*The part of the cytoskeleton (the internal framework of a cell) composed of actin and associated proteins. Includes actin cytoskeleton-associated complexes. [GOC:jl, ISBN:0395825172, ISBN:0815316194]"*That part of the nuclear content other than the chromosomes or the nucleolus. [GOC:ma, ISBN:0124325653]"*"The region of a chromosome that includes the centromeric DNA and associated proteins. In monocentric chromosomes, this region corresponds to a single area of the chromosome, whereas in holocentric chromosomes, it is evenly distributed along the chromosome. [GOC:cjm, GOC:elh, GOC:kmv, GOC:pr]"*The part of the cytoplasm that does not contain organelles but which does contain other particulate matter, such as protein complexes. [GOC:hgd, GOC:jl]"*A small, dense body one or more of which are present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus. This association results in the formation of ribonucleoprotein precursors; these pass into the cytoplasm and mature into the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome.
