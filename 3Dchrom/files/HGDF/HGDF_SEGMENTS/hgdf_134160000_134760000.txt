For cells without external protective or external encapsulating structures this refers to space outside of the plasma membrane. This term covers the host cell environment outside an intracellular parasite. [GOC:go_curators]*The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the placenta over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The placenta is an organ of metabolic interchange between fetus and mother, partly of embryonic origin and partly of maternal origin. [GOC:add, ISBN:068340007X]*The part of a cell or its extracellular environment in which a gene product is located. A gene product may be located in one or more parts of a cell and its location may be as specific as a particular macromolecular complex, that is, a stable, persistent association of macromolecules that function together. [GOC:go_curators, NIF_Subcellular:sao-1337158144]*Elemental activities, such as catalysis or binding, describing the actions of a gene product at the molecular level.
