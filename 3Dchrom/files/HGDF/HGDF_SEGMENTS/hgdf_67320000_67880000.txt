[GOC:go_curators, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/complex/documentation/]"*Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a genes coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.
