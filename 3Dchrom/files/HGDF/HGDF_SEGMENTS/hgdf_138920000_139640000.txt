The various elements of the cytoskeleton not only serve in the maintenance of cellular shape but also have roles in other cellular functions, including cellular movement, cell division, endocytosis, and movement of organelles. [GOC:mah, ISBN:0198547684, PMID:16959967]"*Any series of molecular signals in which a small monomeric GTPase relays one or more of the signals. [GOC:mah]*A lipid bilayer along with all the proteins and protein complexes embedded in it an attached to it.

[GOC:go_curators]*A series of molecular signals initiated by the binding of a neurotrophin to a receptor on the surface of the target cell where the receptor possesses tyrosine kinase activity, and ending with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. transcription.

[GOC:go_curators]"*A series of molecular signals which triggers the apoptotic death of a cell. The pathway starts with reception of a signal, and ends when the execution phase of apoptosis is triggered. [GOC:mtg_apoptosis]"*Stimulates the exchange of guanyl nucleotides associated with a GTPase. Under normal cellular physiological conditions, the concentration of GTP is higher than that of GDP, favoring the replacement of GDP by GTP in association with the GTPase.

Under normal cellular physiological conditions, the concentration of GTP is higher than that of GDP, favoring the replacement of GDP by GTP in association with the GTPase.

[GOC:hgd, GOC:jl]"*Any process that activates or increases the activity of a GTPase. [GOC:jl, GOC:mah]"*The process in which a signal is passed on to downstream components within the cell, which become activated themselves to further propagate the signal and finally trigger a change in the function or state of the cell.

[ISBN:0716731363]*The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell.
